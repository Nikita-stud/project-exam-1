# The Traveler Blog

The Project Exam 1 at Noroff University in Norway was a project using all the skills learned up to the point of the project. The idea behind making it a blog post came from my own love for traveling, using my passion and love for coding I used all my design knowledge to make the website as mathematically appealing as possible. This Project represents my passion and love for both the technical and theoretical side of web-development.
